Problems:
1. multi domain on one machine and ssl
2. email sending, 
3. sync performance / table lock issue. need to test, list sync tables and find out the performance
	ASN.1 or some binary format?
	Long connection?
	Generate cloud version ID for datas
	Merge rule if both side changes
	One reseller can only have one connection.
	JBE -> Cloud
	1) uploaded 1 record one time only and direct process 
	2) SQS to another service to import
	3) Conflict process: Jobs(notes, status), Quote(any updates online), Order(?)
	4) For new quote version only transfer header and changed items (confirm with richard) design quote structure on cloud.
	5) delete file when whole file done.
	6) output table management: all with timestamp, upload based on from and end datetime (date >= yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss and date <= yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss), use an independent connection to control transaction and roll back if anything failed. 
	6) Initial upload: without data in output table
	Cloud -> JBE
	1) Download data and cache locally as file (group of data in one file(how to mark partial failed)? each data a file?)
	2) conflict process: Quote(any updates online), Order(?), Jobs(Notes, status), customer, colleagues, account
	3) for new data (only with cloud Id) generate new jbe id and send id back to cloud
	4) DB failure: retry later
	5) When whole file done, delete the file.
4. query, solr in memory, simple db, S3
5. web service authenticate: server part
6. how does client application tell which reseller.
7. S3 storage structure
8. sdb design
